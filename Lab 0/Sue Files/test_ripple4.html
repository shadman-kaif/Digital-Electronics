<h2>Documentation for test_ripple4 </h2>
<pre>
This is a demo of a 4-bit ripple adder.  It consists of two blocks; an
8 bit counter (counter), and a simple 4 bit ripple carry adder (ripple4).

The outputs of the counter are broken into two busses which are inputs
to the 4-bit ripple adder.  ripple4 adds up the outputs from the
counter and the input carry (cin) into cout,sum[3:0] outputs.

<b>Counter:</b>

The counter behaves differently in verilog vs. spice.  In verilog mode
the counter simply counts from 0 up to 2^8-1 (255).  In spice mode the
counter puts all 1's on the A inputs to the ripple adder, and all 0's
on the B inputs.  It then pulses the low order B input from a 0 to a 1
thus causing a ripple across the ripple adder.  This carry ripple in
turn causes all of the Sum outputs to change allowing the critical
path of the adder to be measured.

rippple4 consists of four full adders (FA) tied together using the
classical ripple technique.

<b>Verilog operation:</b>

The counter calls the counter module in counter.vb.  ripple4 can be
netlisted using the ripple4.bv model, or using FA.bv models, or down
to the transistor level.  To run Verilog do the following:

	Sim menu: Change Simulation Mode to verilog (if necessary)
	Sim menu: VERILOG Netlist
	Sim menu: Display Design Hierarchy
	Sim menu: change design hierarchy if desired and hit Netlist
	Sim menu: Init Probe
	hot key: hit "s" to step time - you should see the flags change

<b>Irsim operation:</b>

Irsim is run interactively.  To speed things up you can init and run a
few patterns by sourcing the command file (counter.cmd).  To run
irsim do the following:

	Sim menu: Change Simulation Mode to sim (if necessary)
	Sim menu: SIM It
	Go to the window you started sue from and type:
		i counter
	This will run the command found in the file counter.cmd
	You can also run other irsim commands by typing i followed
	by a space and then the command.
	select wires then type "p" for plot also works.

<b>Spice operation:</b>

The counter has a spice circuit under the icon.  It does NOT relate to
the counter verilog.  The reason is that it would take too long to
spice all possible patterns.  Spice operation was described above. To
run spice do the following:

	Sim menu: Change Simulation Mode to spice (if necessary)
	Sim menu: SPICE Netlist
	hot key: hit "h" - spice should run and nst should come up
	select wires then type "p" for plot net.
